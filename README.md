# Hand-Written-Text-Detection

# Description

To what extent can a computer recognize humanâ€™s hand written text? How much information can it extract from the text? This project aims to detect the hand writing in a given image and count the number of characters, words and lines. In its basic form, the program should be able to extract text from the image, and then segment this text into a set of lines, words and characters of each word. The text can be slightly rotated.
